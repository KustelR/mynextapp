# Little pet project to learn next

I needed to learn next, so i decided to build this. Simple social network with posts, users etc. It should use SSR and CSR, though most things will be still statically rendered as there is no need of it most of the time.

## Deployment

I last touched this a year and a half ago so i just keep old note on the deployment here

For it to work you need to specify 2 env variables:

1. API_HOST - your v2 api URL
2. API_HOST_LEGACY - your v1 api URL

then `npm install; npm run build; npm run start`

## Revision

So i ended my _little adventure_ and want to get to work ASAP so i fix my old project to gain some kind of working with legacy experience, hope it will have at least some educational value.
